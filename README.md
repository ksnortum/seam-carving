# seam-carving
This is a school [project from HyperSkill](https://hyperskill.org/projects/100) that uses seam carving to resize an image.  The image is shrunk without ratio distorsion or cropping.  The app currently works only on PNG files and shrinking the image.

### Execution

Running the app requires compiling, creating a jar file, then executing it in Java.  See [this link](
https://kotlinlang.org/docs/command-line.html) for details.

The app takes four options:

* `-in` the file name of the image to resize
* `-out` the file name of the new, resized image
* `-width` how much the width of the image should be shrunk by
* `-height` how much the height of the image should be shrunk by

### TODO
* use other file formats
* CLI
